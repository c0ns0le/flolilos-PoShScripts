# flolilo's PowerShell-Scripts

**All my often used scripts.**
While I put quite some effort in some of them (especially the EXIF ones), I still do not think that they would require the effort of being standalone repositories. In reality, this is more of a private repo to prevent screw-ups; of course, you can use or modify any of the tools to your liking.
Of course, some of them could potentially do nasty things, especially since they are not very well tested. So please, don't trust any of the scripts blindly!

Below is a list of folders that tries to sort the scripts in some general categories and the name of the scripts at hand, including a small description:
